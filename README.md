## Hi there. Name is Sara, and I done this as a test asked by a DBC recruiter.

This is a customizable and reusable Dropdown component.

# How run

# Things to consider

- I used a bit of what I understand about Atomic Design.
- It is a customizable component. You can configure it to display the dropdown list at top or at bottom of button, as well as at left or at right.
- Dropdown items list is customizable.
- If you click on button, while dropdown is closed, it will open.
- If you click on button, while dropdown is open, it will close.
- If you click outside the dropdown, it will close.
- If you click on dropdown list item, it should do something.
- I think I did this in about 1 hour. Most of it was figuring out why TS was screaming at me when I was doing the click outside thingy.
- It should work for people who don't have a mouse.
- Buttons and links can be used simultaneously.
- I did it with a whole lot of love.
